# Project: Booking Room Online System (BROS)

## Scenario

You are tasked to develop a simple facility booking application for a school. This is a standalone 
console application that runs in single-user mode.

Students do not have access to this application; only clerks do. Students who wish to book facilities 
will have to make a request through a clerk, who will then enter their booking requests into this
application using the clerk's computer console. The clerk will then advise the student as to the status 
of each of their bookings. Therefore, the clerk will be the only user of BROS. Each student will be 
allocated a virtual currency called “E$” that will be used to pay for bookings.
